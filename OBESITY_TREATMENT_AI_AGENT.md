# GlabitAI: Obesity Treatment Follow-up AI Agent

## Project Overview

GlabitAI is an intelligent medical AI agent designed for comprehensive follow-up care of obesity patients undergoing GLP-1 treatment (Ozempic/Semaglutide). The system proactively monitors patient progress, gathers critical health data, provides emotional support, and alerts healthcare teams when medical attention is needed.

## Clinical Objective

Create a virtual companion that supports obese patients during their treatment journey, serving as an intermediary between patients and their multidisciplinary medical team (doctor, nutritionist, psychologist, personal trainer) while ensuring continuous monitoring and early intervention when needed.

## Core Functionality

### Patient Monitoring

- **Weight tracking**: Regular weight measurements and trend analysis
- **Behavioral assessment**: Eating habits, exercise compliance, medication adherence
- **Psychological state**: Mood tracking, anxiety levels, treatment motivation
- **Side effect monitoring**: GLP-1 medication side effects (nausea, fatigue, injection site reactions)
- **Treatment milestones**: Progress toward weight loss goals and health improvements

### Proactive Communication

- **Automated check-ins**: Frequency varies based on treatment phase (daily/weekly/monthly)
- **Educational content**: Treatment information, nutrition guidance, exercise tips
- **Motivational support**: Encouragement, progress celebration, plateau management
- **Reminder system**: Medication injections, medical appointments, lab tests

### Alert System

- **Medical alerts**: Severe side effects, rapid weight changes, treatment non-compliance
- **Psychological alerts**: Depression indicators, eating disorder signs, treatment abandonment risk
- **Escalation protocol**: Automatic notification to appropriate healthcare team member
