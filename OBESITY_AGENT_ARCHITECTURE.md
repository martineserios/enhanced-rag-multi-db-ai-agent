## Agent Interaction Patterns

### 1. **Sequential Consultation**
Patient query → Orchestrator → Appropriate Specialist → Response
*Used for: Specific domain questions (nutrition, exercise, medication)*

### 2. **Parallel Consultation**
Patient query → Orchestrator → Multiple Specialists → Synthesized Response
*Used for: Complex issues requiring multidisciplinary input*

### 3. **Escalation Chain**
Specialist Agent → Medical Supervision → Human Healthcare Team
*Used for: Emergency situations or concerning clinical findings*

### 4. **Proactive Monitoring**
Monitoring Agent → Risk Detection → Appropriate Specialist → Patient Contact
*Used for: Scheduled check-ins and automated health monitoring*

## Communication Protocols

### Agent-to-Agent Communication
- **Shared Context**: All agents access unified patient profile and treatment history
- **Handoff Protocols**: Structured information transfer between agents
- **Conflict Resolution**: Medical Supervision Agent has final authority on clinical decisions
- **Documentation**: All inter-agent communications logged for audit trail

### Patient Communication
- **Single Interface**: Patient interacts with unified system, not individual agents
- **Seamless Transitions**: Context maintained across different specialist domains
- **Transparency**: Patient informed when different specialists are consulted
- **Emergency Protocols**: Direct escalation to human healthcare team when needed

## Implementation Architecture

### Technical Stack
- **LangGraph**: Multi-agent workflow orchestration
